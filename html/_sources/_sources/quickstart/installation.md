## Installation

To install, and manage dependencies and virtual environments this project uses Poetry. Follow the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install Poetry.

From the root directory `poetry update` followed by `poetry install` - this will establish a venv with all the needed dependencies.

Once your venv is made you can use `poetry run [command]` to run a single CLI command inside the venv.

You can use `poetry shell` to enter into the venv.
