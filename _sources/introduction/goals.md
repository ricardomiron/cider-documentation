# Goals for cider

Cider is a set of software tools for creating poverty predictions based on non-traditional data sources (such as call detail records and satellite imagery) and for evaluating the accuracy, fairness, representativity, and reliability of those predictions. Our goals for cider are to enable:

- Policymakers and aid workers, working in conjunction with telecom operators, to remotely and rapidly estimate the poverty of individuals;

- Policymakers to compare and evaluate targeting options when designing poverty alleviation programs, allowing them to choose the optimal option or combination of options;

- Policymakers to test for bias and fairness in poverty predictions;

- Researchers and developers to collaborate and add to the code to create toolkit for poverty targeting
