# Adherance to data privacy standards

As Cider works with  individual mobile phone data (personally identifiable information PII), several guidelines must be followed to achieve data privacy and security best practices. First, the use of Cider must be in compliance with local data protection laws. Additionally, we recommend referring to the following guidelines to design a program specific data flow that adheres to both the local laws as well as international standards of best practices.

- [Data Protection Manual from IOM (International Organisation for Migration)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://publications.iom.int/books/iom-data-protection-manual&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1633755101445000&usg=AOvVaw14AneDHPkaqvfhGa12IaPj)

- [ISO 27701 or PIMS (Privacy Information Management System)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27701:ed-1:v1:en), a certification that assesses if the management of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is secure.

- [PPP guidelines from GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications Association)](https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Innovative-Data-for-Urban-Planning-Opportunities-and-Challenges-Associated-with-Public-Private-Data-Partnerships-SPREADS.pdf)

- [Data Protection Handbook for Humanitarian Action from ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross)](https://www.icrc.org/en/data-protection-humanitarian-action-handbook)

We also strongly recommend that parties deploy the opt-in and opt-out functionality that determines which subscribers have their data analyzed. Cider's roadmap plan also has extra layers of encryption functionality and workflows, where PII is encrypted before consent and only decrypted for analysis after a subscriber has consented.
