# Goals for cider

CIDER is a set of software tools for creating poverty predictions based on non-traditioinal data sources (such as call detail records and satellite imagery) and for evaluating the accuracy, fairness, representativity, and reliability of those predictions. Our goals for CIDER are to enable:

- Public policy specialists and aid workers, working in conjunction with telecom operators, to remotely and rapidly estimate the poverty of individuals who opt in to services;

- Aid workers and public policy specialists to quickly and more accurately create poverty indices;

- Policymakers to compare and evaluate targeting options when designing poverty alleviation programs, allowing them to choose the optimal option or combination of options;

- Public policy specialists to test for bias and representation in poverty predictions;
Researchers and technical specialists to collaborate and add to the code and contribute new applications such as differential privacy on these applications.
