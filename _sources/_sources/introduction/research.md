## Poverty prediction and targeting with digital data

Cider was developed from a line of research on estimating poverty from machine learning and mobile phone data that dates back to 2015. The following papers provide context on this research and discussions of the accuracy, fairness, and practicality of phone-based targeting in several contexts.
