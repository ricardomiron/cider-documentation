# Adherance to data privacy standards

Cider works with  individual mobile phone data, which is personally identifiable information. The use of cider must be in compliance with local data protection laws. We additionally recommend referring to the following guidelines to design a data flow that adheres to international standards:

- [Data Protection Manual from the IOM (International Organisation for Migration)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://publications.iom.int/books/iom-data-protection-manual&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1633755101445000&usg=AOvVaw14AneDHPkaqvfhGa12IaPj)

- [PPP guidelines from the GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications Association)](https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Innovative-Data-for-Urban-Planning-Opportunities-and-Challenges-Associated-with-Public-Private-Data-Partnerships-SPREADS.pdf)

- [Data Protection Handbook for Humanitarian Action from the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross)](https://www.icrc.org/en/data-protection-humanitarian-action-handbook)

We also strongly recommend that parties deploy the opt-in and opt-out functionality that determines which subscribers have their data analyzed. Cider's roadmap plan also has extra layers of encryption functionality and workflows, where PII is encrypted before consent and only decrypted for analysis after a subscriber has consented.
